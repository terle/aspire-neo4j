# Contributing to NorthernNerds.Aspire.Neo4j

This is my first NuGet package and my first contribution to the broader developer community. I needed this functionality for my own projects and wanted to share it with others who might benefit from it.

I think (and hope) that Aspire will take off, and I love graph databases. By creating this package, I hope to ease the inclusion of Neo4j for other developers.

I would **love** contributions, additions, mentions, comments, and more. Just keep them polite, full of love and respect, and let's work together to make better software.

Thank you for being a part of this journey!
